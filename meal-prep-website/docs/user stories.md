User Stories for Meal Prep Website New Features
Based on the meal prep website project I can see, I'd like to help you develop user stories for new features. Looking at the current implementation, I can see you've already established a foundation with backend and frontend components, including an onboarding process with user preference collection.

Here are some potential user stories organized by feature area that would enhance the meal prep website:
